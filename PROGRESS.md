# Project Progress — AliceUT (Amazon Clone)

Daily log of work on this project. Newest entry on top. One entry per active day.

**How to update**
- At session end, or when a milestone lands, add a new dated section at the top (below this header).
- Keep each subsection to bullets. If a subsection is empty, omit it.
- Use ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Each day gets an explicit `<a id="YYYY-MM-DD"></a>` anchor immediately above its heading so external links resolve reliably (GitHub also auto-anchors the heading, but the explicit id survives renderer differences). Add the new date to the **Index** below.

**Index**
- [2026-08-19](#2026-08-19) — Requirements freeze + repo scaffolding.

## 2026-08-19
**Focus:** Requirements freeze + repo scaffolding for Phase 1.

**Done:**
- BRD v1.1 signed off (`phase-1/requirements/BRD.md`).
- User stories split by role into `phase-1/requirements/user-stories/` — 39 stories across buyer / seller / admin / platform, indexed by `README.md`.
- Linked Figma file "AliceUT" (`F69ukaWjsqx4adgo26vDFQ`) as authoritative design source; recorded in `CLAUDE.md` → *Design Reference*.
- Draft screens for "Buyer" in Figma

**Decisions:**
- Locked stack per BRD §7.1 / §13 — Angular + Angular Material, NestJS modular monolith, Postgres + Mongo, Elasticsearch, Kafka + Schema Registry, TypeORM w/ raw-SQL migrations, Passport.js + JWT, docker-compose V1 → K8s V2.
- V1 seller currencies restricted to USD / THB / JPY / SGD.
- Money storage `NUMERIC(19,4)` + ISO 4217; app-side `decimal.js`/`Big.js`; API amounts as strings.
- Pricing model: `Product → Offer → Price`; cart/order references `Offer`, never `Product`.
- Order line items snapshot `unit_price`, `currency`, `tax`, `fx_rate_used_at_capture` — never re-derive.
- All domain writes via Kafka **transactional outbox**; consumers idempotent, DLQ per group.

**Blockers:**
- None.

**Next:**
- Design UI and re-align with the user stories
- Kick off Phase 1 **technical design** in `phase-1/technical-design/` — architecture overview, ERD (Postgres + Mongo), API contracts, Kafka event schemas (Avro), outbox pattern doc.
- Backlog decomposition of the 39 user stories into implementation tasks.
- Confirm direction with user before writing any code.
